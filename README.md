# Experimental Analysis of Network Reliability with Varying Component Reliability: A Study Using Exhaustive Enumeration Method


- Investigate how network reliability is affected by component reliability
- Nodes in the network may fail with probability p, which changes in experiments
- Algorithm developed to compute network reliability using exhaustive enumeration method
- Computer program written to implement the algorithm and support error-checking and correctness testing
- Program run for p values ranging from 0.05 to 1 in steps of 0.05
- Graphical diagram shows how network reliability values depend on p.
